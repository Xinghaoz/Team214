 * Your proposal is quite vague and open-ended. I'm not even sure what game you are implementing - a CMU themed monopoly? But it has different rules? Is the game turn-based or does it require real-time commication between different clients? Online games can be quite difficult to implement - you should really try to iron out the details in the planning phase.

 * This proposal is quite vague, and I can't really picture what the end result would be. In the past, many groups creating games have struggled a bit, as game logic can be quite complex and eat up most of the time you spend working on the project. As a result, you might not have the time to demonstrate that you have really learned how to create a functioning, desirable webapp. Usually games are built with the help of game engines - without one you can be spending a lot of time building unnecessary logic on your own, so if you are looking to continue this idea then I would recommend doing research on those beforehand.

 * This sounds like a lot more design work than webapp work. There are a lot of details in game-design that don't seem to be fleshed out in your proposal. For example, what is the object of the game? What elements of the game need to be created? It won't be good if the project turns into a game design project more than a web app project. You might want to take an existing game (ie. board game, card game, etc) and implement that as a web app so you don't have to go through the difficulties of designing a game yourself.
