Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 871d270fa2a5e6f2a19778a4f635bf757100a19e

### The product backlog (10/10)

Your backlog is pretty detailed, but can be improved:
* A spreadsheet-like format is easier to read for backlogs, rather than bulleted lists. You can also explore existing online tools for generating and tracking work on a project. 
* You should have a clear assignment of responsibility for each feature, to the team member(s) who will complete that feature. Each student should have sole responsibility for some features on the overall project. An easy way to organize this is to have a column in your spreadsheet recording the responsible team member.
* You should do a cost estimate for each feature, in hours. If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve your ability to track progress on it.

### Data models (9/10)

* ChatMessage should have field which links it to a game.
* Are you planning to have a game model? How are you planning to record which players are still in the game?
* You did not clearly specify the relationships between your models
* It's unclear what the ability of a role is. Is it just for display? Or does it affect the wealth etc. of a player? If so you should maybe have an Ability model.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)

* According to the backlog, there should be a chat panel on the right hand side, but it isn't shown. There's only a dropdown in the middle of the page which looks like it could be used to send messages.

### Additional Information

It seems like you will be spending a lot of time designing game rules. You might want to develop just 2 maps instead of 4, and use the extra time to explore other web-related technologies, since game design is not one of the learning goals for this course.
